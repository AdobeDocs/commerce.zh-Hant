- description: Added documentation for the optional [Extra Product Attributes module](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce/saas-data-export/extensibility/add-tax-attribute-set-inventory-attributes).
    When this module is installed in an Adobe Commerce environment, the Data Export
    process automatically exports tax class, attribute set, and inventory metadata
    from the Commerce product configuration to the `products` and `product attributes`
    feeds.
